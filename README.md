# Meme Bet

This is an app that allows people to post memes in both the social-silly sense, and in the more serious meta-level zeitgeist sense.

An example of the former would be pictures of exploding cats (The new The Oatmeal boardgame) an example of the latter would be predicting that electric cars will be a larger paradigm in the next 20 years.  Prove that you said stuff before it was stuff! And then have internet glory points to cherish for it. Or buy shirts. I think it would be cool if you could buy shirts with glory points, but that is getting ahead of myself.


TODO and NOTES:

-Set postgres to be the default DB-
-Set routes, controller, and initial views-
Set up the point system
Set up the preloaded tag
	silly
	belief
	event
	song
	video
	system
	loop
CRUD for memes (don't forget form)
CRUD for users (++Auth thru github+google+fb? also add AGE)
What do I want to be able to do in meme bet?
