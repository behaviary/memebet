# Meme Bet

This is an app that allows people to post memes in both the social-silly sense, and in the more serious meta-level zeitgeist sense.

An example of the former would be pictures of exploding cats (The new The Oatmeal boardgame) an example of the latter would be predicting that electric cars will be a larger paradigm in the next 20 years.  Prove that you said stuff before it was stuff! And then have internet glory points to cherish for it. Or buy shirts. I think it would be cool if you could buy shirts with glory points, but that is getting ahead of myself.
